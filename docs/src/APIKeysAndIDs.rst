API Keys & Course IDs
==========================

To find the Canvas ID of a course, look for the numbers in the URL.
Same with Gradescope. Typically it comes after `/courses`.

To obtain a Canvas API Key (to be inputted as a Credential in our system),
go to Canvas -> Profile -> Settings, and under **Active Integrations**,
select `+ New Access Token`. Fill in any forms and copy down the generated
token.
